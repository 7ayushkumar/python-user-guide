Plotly's Python API User Guide
===============================

Welcome to [Plotly's](https://plot.ly) Python API User Guide

The User Guide was written with the goal of giving Plotly Python (and IPython)
users extensive documentation on almost all of Plotly's features. 

Whereas Plotly's [web documentation and
gallery](https://plot.ly/python) is meant to serve Plotly beginners
just looking to make a simple plot and experienced users trying out a new plot
type.  The User Guide intends to make beginner and intermediate Plotly users
experts.

#### Content

The User Guide is entirely written inside [IPython
notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html). 

This Github repository is divided into folders, one for each section or
appendix. Each folder contains one or several IPython notebooks and the required
data files to run them.

Refer to
[Index.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/plotly/python-user-guide/blob/master/Index.ipynb)
for an overview of the notebooks in this repository.


#### Other file(s) in this repo

* `custom.css`: CSS file for notebook styling
