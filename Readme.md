Plotly's Python API User Guide
===============================

Welcome to [Plotly's](https://plot.ly) Python API User Guide

The User Guide was written with the goal of giving Plotly Python (and IPython)
users extensive documentation on almost all of Plotly's features. 

Whereas Plotly's [web documentation and
gallery](https://plot.ly/api/python/docs) is meant to serve Plotly beginners
just looking to make a simple plot and experienced users trying out a new plot
type.  The User Guide intends to make beginner and intermediate Plotly users
experts.

#### Content

The User Guide is entirely written inside [IPython
notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html). 

This Github repository is divided into folders, where each folder contains 
one IPython notebook and their required data files.

The User Guide homepage is in folder `s00_homepage` and its notebook can be found
[here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/etpinard/plotly-python-doc/tree/1.0/s00_homepage/s00_homepage.ipynb).
