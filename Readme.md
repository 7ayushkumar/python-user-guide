Plotly's Python API User Guide
===============================

*Welcome to [Plotly's](https://plot.ly) Python API User Guide!*

The User Guide was written with the goal of giving Plotly Python (and IPython)
users extensive documentation on almost all of Plotly's features. 

#### In Brief:

The User Guide is entirely written inside [IPython
notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html). 

This repository is divided into folders, one for each section or
appendix. Each folder contains one or several IPython notebooks and the required
data files to run them.

Tis repository implements a handful of scripts (using `makefile`) with the
purpose of the User Guide's notebook to *publishable* HTML files constituting
the backbone of the Python API User Guide section of [plot.ly](https://plot.ly).

The User Guide's homepage resides on
[plot.ly/python/user-guide](https://plot.ly/python/user-guide/).

Refer to [`Contributing.md`](./Contributing.md) for more.
